Acme Cron Service - Postfix
==========================

This is an ansible role for reloading services using certificates from let's encrypt, after the certs were renewed.
For everything related to the creation of the certs see the inofix.acme-\* roles. The main rule which also
has the details in its README is inofix.ansible-acme-setup.

This role is meant to be run on any host that needs certificates.

Why we do not use one of the existing roles?

* For the first reason read the section "Promise" below. We need something reliable.
* This role will be used by [maestro](https://github.com/inofix/maestro) and must follow the logic used there. (Of course, the role can be used without maestro..)


State
-----

UNSTABLE!


Promise
-------

Sure, this role may change in the future, but we will only expand features to not break backwards compatibility.

If radical changes should become necessary, a new role will be created, probably with an 'ng' or version suffix...
